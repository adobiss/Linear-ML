# Numpy-ml
Numpy-ml is a collection of machine learning (ML) algorithms created in Python using NumPy. The goal of this project is to enhance understanding of the basic principles of these algorithms and how they can be implemented in Python.

## Key Features
* Contains implementation of numerous ML algorithms from scratch using Python and NumPy.
* This list is continually growing, so check back for updates!

## Algorithm List
* linear-logic-gate-v1 (Perceptron)
* linear-logic-gate-v2 (Perceptron)
